\title{TrEMBL to SwissProt by gene names}
\usage{
uniprot_genesymbol_cleanup(uniprots, organism = 9606, only_trembls = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{uniprots}{Character vector possibly containing TrEMBL IDs.}

\item{organism}{Character or integer: organism name or identifier.}

\item{only_trembls}{Attempt to convert only known TrEMBL IDs of the
organism. This is the recommended practice.}
}
\value{
Data frame with two columns: "input" and "output". The first one
    contains all identifiers from the input vector `uniprots`. The second
    one has the corresponding identifiers which are either SwissProt IDs
    with gene names identical to the TrEMBL IDs in the input, or if no
    such records are available, the output has the input items unchanged.

\description{
TrEMBL to SwissProt by gene names
}
\details{
Sometimes one gene or protein is represented by multiple identifiers in
UniProt. These are typically slightly different isoforms, some of them
having TrEMBL IDs, some of the SwissProt. For the purposes of most systems
biology application, the most important is to identify the protein or gene
in a way that we can recognize it in other datasets. Unfortunately UniProt
or Ensembl do not seem to offer solution for this issue. Hence, if we find
that a TrEMBL ID has a gene name which is also associated with a SwissProt
ID, we replace this TrEMBL ID by that SwissProt. There might be a minor
difference in their sequence, but most of the omics analyses do not even
consider isoforms. And it is quite possible that later UniProt will convert
the TrEMBL record to an isoform within the SwissProt record. Typically
this translation is not so important (but still beneficial) for human,
but for other organisms it is critical especially when translating from
foreign identifiers.

This function accepts a mixed input of UniProt IDs and provides a distinct
translation table that you can use to translate your data.
