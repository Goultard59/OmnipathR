\title{Downloads TF-target interactions from ReMap}
\usage{
remap_dorothea_download()
}
\value{
Data frame with TF-target relationships.
}
\description{
ReMap (\url{http://remap.univ-amu.fr/}) is a database of ChIP-Seq
experiments. It provides raw and merged peaks and CRMs (cis regulatory
motifs) with their associations to regulators (TFs). TF-target
relationships can be derived as it is written in Garcia-Alonso et al.
2019: "For ChIP-seq, we downloaded the binding peaks from ReMap and scored
the interactions between each TF and each gene according to the distance
between the TFBSs and the genesâ€™ transcription start sites. We evaluated
different filtering strategies that consisted of selecting only the
top-scoring 100, 200, 500, and 1000 target genes for each TF."

This function returns the top TF-target relationships as used in DoRothEA:
