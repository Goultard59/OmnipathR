\title{Downloads TF-target interactions from ReMap}
\usage{
remap_tf_target_download()
}
\value{
Data frame with TF-target relationships.
}
\description{
ReMap (http://remap.univ-amu.fr/) is a database of ChIP-Seq experiments.
It provides raw and merged peaks and CRMs (cis regulatory motifs) with
their associations to regulators (TFs). TF-target relationships can be
derived as it is written in Garcia-Alonso et al. 2019: "For ChIP-seq, we
downloaded the binding peaks from ReMap and scored the interactions
between each TF and each gene according to the distance between the TFBSs
and the genesâ€™ transcription start sites. We evaluated different filtering
strategies that consisted of selecting only the top-scoring 100, 200, 500,
and 1000 target genes for each TF."
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6673718/#s1title). This
function retrieves the full processed TF-target list from the data
deposited in https://zenodo.org/record/3713238.
