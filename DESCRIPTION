Description: A client for the OmniPath web service
    (https://www.omnipathdb.org) and many other resources.
    It also includes functions to transform and pretty print
    some of the downloaded data, functions to access a number
    of other resources such as BioPlex, ConsensusPathDB, EVEX,
    Guide to Pharmacology (IUPHAR/BPS), Harmonizome, HTRIdb,
    InWeb InBioMap, Pathway Commons, Ramilowski et al. 2015,
    RegNetwork, ReMap, TF census, TRRUST and Vinayagam et al.
    2011. Furthermore, OmnipathR features a close integration
    with the NicheNet method for ligand activity prediction
    from transcriptomics data, and its R implementation
    `nichenetr` (available only on github).
