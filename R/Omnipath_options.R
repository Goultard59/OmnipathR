#' These options describe the default settings for OmnipathR so you do not
#' need to pass these parameters at each function call.
#' Currently the only option useful for the public web service at
#' omnipathdb.org is ``omnipath.license``. If you are a for-profit
#' user set it to ``'commercial'`` to make sure all the data you download
#' from OmniPath is legally allowed for commercial use. Otherwise just leave
#' it as it is: ``'academic'``.
#' If you don't use omnipathdb.org but within your organization you deployed
#' your own pypath server and want to share data whith a limited availability
#' to outside users, you may want to use a password. For this you can use
#' the ``omnipath.password`` option.
#' Also if you want the R package to work from another pypath server instead
#' of omnipathdb.org, you can change the option ``omnipath.url``.
